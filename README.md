# visualize_flights
**Visualize flights** module has a self-explanatory name, it allows to visualize flights :-).

The module includes the **Flights Visual Analysis Tool**, which is an app with a GUI that queries a data base containing 
flights (trajectories).

The figure below illustrates the GUI, which has three main parts: Filters (left-hand side), Map (right-hand side), and Bearing Data 
(left-hand side under Filters, not displayed in the figure).

When a user sets filters and presses *Load flights* button, 
flights' trajectories will be loaded and displayed one-be-one upon pressing button *Next*. 
It is also possible to go back to the previous trajectory by pressing *Previous*. 

A trajectory example can be seen in the figure below:
